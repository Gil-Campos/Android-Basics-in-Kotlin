# Write your first program in kotlin

Before we begin learning kotlin there a few things that I want to talk with you... and no this it not a talk like those you mom or dan would give you ok, do you know what a program is? I will assume you said "No, I don't know" so that I can explained it to you.

What is a **program**?

Well a program is a series of instructions for the system to perform some action. For example you could do a program that creates a birthday card based on someone's age from their birthday.

But you can't just whisper to the computer "do this pls" you need to communicate with the computer in some way to create the birthday card and that way is programming just like you use human language to communicate with people, you use a programming language to communicate with the operating system of your computer and don't worry this sounds really complex but it's actually really simple and logical.

Android apps are written in Kotlin a programming language weird name right? Kotlin is a modern language some say that is the best version of Java and it is to be honest.

Before we learn on how to create real and useful apps we need to know the basics of programming and learning the basics at the same time learning to create an app it will be challenging.

We are going to use a code editor maybe it's the first time you hear this word but is like google docs that helps you create documents, check your grammar and a lot more things. In this section we are going to use an interactive Kotlin editor within your browser. This means that you do not have to install any software to take your first step towards app development to start please open the file 'run-ur-1-kotlin-program'.

### Prerequisites

- A computer with a modern web browser like Google Chrome.
- Internet access for your computer.
