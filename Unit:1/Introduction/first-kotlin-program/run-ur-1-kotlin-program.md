# Run your first program in Kotlin

Here you will be using a editor on a website to start programming in the Kotlin language and learn the little pieces that makes it.

First I wan you to go to this website wich is `https://developer.android.com/training/kotlinplayground` this is a web based tool that will help us to create your first program.

You should something like this or similar to the screenshot below, with a code editor in the middle.

![Kotlin Compiler](/Unit%3A1/Introduction/img/kotlin-web-compiler.png)

The editor comes with a code `println("Hello, world!")` that is inside the main function we'll explain later what is the purpose of the main function.

### Run the program code

Let's see what this program does! 

1. In the editor, in the top-right corner, find the white or green triangle and click it to run the program.
2. Look at the pane at the bottom.

    `Hello, world!`

3. Notice `Hello, world` printed, like in the code above. So now you know what this program does: It prints, or outputs, a hello world message.

Great now we can make modifications to our code! Go to 'modify-ur-program' file.
